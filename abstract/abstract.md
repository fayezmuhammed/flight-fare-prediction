# Abstract

In the rapidly growing travel and tourism industry, accurately predicting flight fares is a valuable tool for both consumers and airline operators. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based model to predict flight ticket prices using structured data related to airlines, routes, travel class, time of travel, and booking period.

The dataset was preprocessed through feature encoding, handling of outliers, and normalization. Various regression models were implemented, with Linear Regression serving as the baseline approach. Key features such as departure time, days left until travel, and number of stops were found to significantly influence ticket prices.

The model's performance was evaluated using metrics like R-squared and RMSE, and the predictions showed a promising correlation with actual prices. This project demonstrates how data-driven models can enhance fare transparency and help customers make informed decisions.
